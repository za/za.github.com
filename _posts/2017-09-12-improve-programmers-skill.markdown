Recently, I attended [PyCon APAC 2017](https://pycon.my/2017/09/01/pycon-apac-2017-its-a-wrap/)
which was held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It's always nice to meet new people 
and share stories.

It turned out, the most interesting talk for me was one of the session in lightning 
talk. It was delivered by Ivan.

Ivan shared that programmers should always upgrade their skill and it can't be 
done by working on our daily routine. We should take class, do some side 
projects, or even try some code contest.

For example, solving a simple problem but only using the standard library. If 
most of the time we are requests library to make HTTP access, now try not to use 
requests library. Instead just use Python standard library.

I definitely want to always upgrade my skill. I just have to find the time and 
the method that suits me. I found reading still important, but I guess problem 
solving still the best way to practice.
