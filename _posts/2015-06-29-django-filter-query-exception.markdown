While looking for answers on this question: "Does multiple monitor increase
programmer's productivity?", I found interesting tips from
[Joelon Software](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html)
blog post. It's the fourth Joel's Test: **A Bug Database**. 

Since, I still don't know yet what tool will help us to store our bugs, I'll
write my _first_ bug in this blog post. And also I'd like to know how to write
snippet in Jekyll, which powered this blog. 

So, let's give it a shot! 

Example, I am querying database using Django query filter. 

{% highlight python %}

try:
	borrowed_books = Book.objects.filter(borrow_date__lte=datetime.today(), 
		user=request.user, borrow_status=True)
except Book.DoesNotExist:
	raise Http404("You're not borrowing any books")

{% endhighlight %}

This code will not return the exception eventhough there is no match with the
filter rule. **No match filter query will only return empty list**. So, I need to
fix the code. 

Let's try to debug using the django shell.

{% highlight python %}

>>> from aurora.apps.users.models import User
>>> u1 = User.objects.get(email='borrower101@aurora.co')
>>> from aurora.apps.books.models import Book
>>> borrowing = Book.objects.filter(borrow_date__lte=datetime.today(), user=u, 
		borrow_status=True)
[]
>>> u2 = User.objects.get(email='borrower102@aurora.co')
>>> borrowing = Book.objects.filter(borrow_date__lte=datetime.today(), user=u, 
		borrow_status=True)
[<Book: Dahl, Roald>, <Book: Griffith, Andy>]

{% endhighlight %}

So user u1 doesn't borrow any books while u2 borrows 2 books. What to do to
improve this code? We could check the query length. If the query length equalas
to zero then we could throw the exception. 

{% highlight python %}

borrowed_books = Book.objects.filter(borrow_date__lte=datetime.today(), 
	user=request.user, borrow_status=True)

if borrowed_books.count() == 0:		
	raise Http404("You're not borrowing any books")

{% endhighlight %}

That's all for now.
