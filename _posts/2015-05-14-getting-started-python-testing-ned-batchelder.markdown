This post is for my personal bookmark. Since I am new to testing, this [video](https://youtu.be/FxSsnHeWQBY) is really helping me on getting started with testing in Python. And do you know what makes it so great? Ned also provides [the complete write up](http://nedbatchelder.com/text/test0.html) of his presentation! So if I don't have time to watch the video completely, I could jump to his write up.
