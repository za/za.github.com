Wow, it's already 2019! And I just skipped 2018 without even a single post! For
this post, I just want to write short.

So far, I have two ideas on writing a new post. They are:

* Migrating legacy Django hash password
* Testing Django form with real data

Let's hope I can write this soon. See you!
