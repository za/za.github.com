Sorry. This is only a test post with 'python' categories. I will use this 'python' categories which will be aggregated in [planet.python.org](http://planet.python.org). I would like to say thank you to [matematikaadit](https://github.com/matematikaadit) for this [pull request](https://github.com/za/za.github.io/pull/1).

So, now I could generate feed based on categories. [Voila!](http://za.github.io/feed.python.xml)
