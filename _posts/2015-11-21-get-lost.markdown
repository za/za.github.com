Working with multiple monitors seem like a programmer's heaven. Yes, it is. I 
like it. And now, I really enjoying my first vertical screen ever. Unfortunately 
I might only use this rotateable monitor this weeend.

The difficult thing about working with multiple monitors (then multiple tabs) is 
finding which the tab that currently you need it. Sometimes I need to scroll 
each tab to find the right tab and move mouse pointer to other monitors.

And the other _get lost_ thing is when english is not your native language. You 
might miss the context in a informal conversation since mostly I learn english 
in a formal context.

I am a bit tired actually when writing this post. I've tried to get my Django 
app to return JSON value. Now I need to visualize this using d3.js In the 
morning, we had a djangolow-down by Mitch and we just finished OWASP Top 10 in 
Django by Brenton.

Then when I tried to post a blog on my wordpress blog, the Internet was not 
working. So, I wrote this blog in a git post. Hopefully the `git push` will 
work.
