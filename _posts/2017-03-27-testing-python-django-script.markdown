Now I am thinking a better approach on testing Python/Django script. I have a
Python script which runs in a Django application. For example, this script will
send an email with how many new users registered in this week.

So far, I use the manual approach, which requires me to have new user registered
within this week. I am not very satisfied with this approach, as the script is
getting complex, I need to manually prepare the data.

Any idea?
